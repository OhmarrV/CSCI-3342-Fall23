            <div class="flexbox-container">
            <p><span>Review:</span> The Bacon cheese burger from whataburger is a go to staple at whataburger for many people.
            The only downside is that it lacks that "spice" that some of the limited time or specialty burgers have. 
            Other than maybe being a little boring, the taste is FAR from that and makes a perfect order.</p>

            <p><span>Review:</span> The Orignal, Classic, Foundational burger, the number 1. is the original whataburger 
            burger. There is nothing like it... The number 1. is the OG burger that is the perfect combination of
            meat, buns, veggies, and sauce of your choice. Like I said, there really is nothing like it.</p>

            <p><span>Review:</span> OK, HEAR ME OUT. As a prior mushroom hater, I would have never imagined liking this burger.
            But remeber the day I recieved the wrong order and ended up with a 3 mushroom swiss burgers in my
            bag instead of my avocado bacon burger... I was truly gifted from the heavens above. I definitely
            recommend everyone to try this burger, you will NOT be disappointed!</p>

            <p><span>Review:</span> Oh what used to be. The avocado bacon burger used to be my all time favorite.
            I can't even recal the amount of years I went ordering "The avocado bacon burger, no onions, and
            on regular buns." (MUST SAY REGULAR BUNS) Unfortunately, as of the last year, the quality of this
            burger has gone downhill drastically, but I will keep it up top for the personal memories I have
            with it.</p>

            <p><span>Review:</span> The only reason this burger is not on this top 5 list is because you CAN'T
            order it all day!! Only available until 11am. The breakfast burger is quite literally, THE
            breakfast burger.</p>

            <p><span>Review:</span> There are no words that can describe how much I LOVE this burger. I just
            recently tried it, as it's a new limited release, and it is perfect. It is a 10/10 and I
            pray that it becomes a fan favorite addition to the menu. Please...</p>
